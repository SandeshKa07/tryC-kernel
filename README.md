# tryC-kernel
* complete Operating system is built on the C-languauge.
* one cannot claim to be a system developer/kernel developer without the best
  knowledge in C.
* At the same time to catch up with the latest development on the open-source,
  it is good to know the basics of the linux kernel firmly.
* So my reposiroty here is just to try out different concepts in C, know basics
  of kernel, try to hack into linux-kernel by using what is learnt.
